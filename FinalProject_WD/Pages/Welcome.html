    <p class="p2">
        Among the dozen, if not hundreds of indigenous communities that live in North America, the Cree where among one of the most biggest. 
        Pre dating the Europeans, the Cree once expanded across Canada, occupying territory in the Subarctic region all the way from Alberta to Quebec, even stretching into the Plains region in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
        <br>
        <br>
       The cold and natural land both familiar yet different, the Cree (like many indigenous cultures) lived with an intimate connection to the land, living a nomadic life as they hunted and grew there connection across what we now know as modern day Canada.
        <br>
        <br>
       But unlike what many may think, the culture still lives today. Having endured many difficulties, hardships and setbacks before and after the infamous Indian Residential Schools, the Cree have displayed, both in that era and after into their future, always marching forward with an unshakeable resilience.
         <br>
         <br>

      So without further ado, enjoy the beautiful, expansive and tragic history of one North America's largest indigenous cultures.
