     <h1 id="Population">Population</h1>
     <p id="par1">Out of all the Indigenous nations in both Quebec and Canada the Cree are one of the most populated communities to exist, with an estimate total of 90000 
        across the continent, 21000 of that sample living in Quebec alone, and a total of 356 655 claiming to have some Cree ancestory across Canada, according to a 2016 census.
        <br>
        <br>
        Among these population are multiple languages and dialect that have formed due to the scale of the land they traveled. These included but  not limited to, Plains Cree (nehiyawak) that formed in Alberta & Saskatchewan.
         Sakawiyiniwak in Saskatchewan & Manitoba,as well as Eeyouch in Quebec. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite being one of the most populated remaining indigenous communities, with some of the largest spread across Canada. The Cree live almost exclusively in a few settlements. 
        One of the larger of these settlemtns, for example, was founded in 1993, the village of Oujé-Bougoumou, with its modern architecture, became a model for integrating the modern Indigenous way of life. 
        Designed by architect Douglas Cardinal, it has garnered numerous international awards, including one from the United Nations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately efforts are still underway to improve the quality of life in Cree settlements. 
        In some provinces, over 60% of indigenous children live in poverty.  
        The child poverty rate among status First Nations children hovers around 50%, a rate that puts these nations on par with Mexico. 
        Issues in these settlements include but are not limited to, overcrowded housing with the number of those living in the house being higher then the number of rooms, 
        a low education rate with the typical canadian 80.9% rate of employement for educated citizens being low as 71% for indigenous people such as the Cree.

     <h1 id="Economy"> History</h1>
     <p id="par1">During pre colonial times, their traditional economy focused on bison hunting and gathering wild plant foods. 
            After the arrival of the european exporers, and the aquiring horses and firearms through trade, they're economy became more militant than the other indigenous cultures, relying on raiding and warring against many other Plains peoples to fund and feed themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            However the Cree would later be able to turn to new form of economic success with the establishment of fur trading posts after 1670, which began a period of economically motivated migration, as bands attempted to make the most of the growing fur trade. 
            To add on to the economic opportunities for the Cree was the trading of meats, with European traders depended on Indigenous people for fresh meat. 
            Gradually, an increasing number of Cree remained near the posts, hunting and doing odd jobs and becoming involved in the church, schools and nursing stations.
            <br>
            <br>
            Eventually, the Cree Nation experienced major economic growth following the signing of the JBNQA, which led to the creation of several businesses. 
            In 1982, the Cree founded the Cree Regional Economic Enterprises Company (CREECO), which manages several enterprises, including the Cree Construction and Development Company, a leader in the construction industry in Québec. Another company, Air Creebec, also owned by the Cree, connects the James Bay territory and Northern Ontario to Montréal and Val-d’Or.
            Cree communities also boast a number of community enterprises and private companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            However in contemporary times, Self-government and economic development are major contemporary goals of the Cree.
            Cree First Nations across Canada have attempted to negotiate with development corporations and governments in hopes to transform there mostly impoverished communities into something better.
            For example, the Lubicon First Nation of Alberta have sued the provincial and federal governments for their share of natural gas revenues and further recognition of treaty rights. 
            Another examples lies in Manitoba, where several Cree nations have reached agreements with the federal and provincial governments, as well as resource companies, with all these attempted negotations hoping to allow the Cree new opportunites to improve there lives, with varied degrees of success.
